\documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi

\usepackage{tabularx}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{placeins}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
We study a custom Gymnasium environment, \emph{RL Chef}, where an agent navigates a $5\times5$ grid, collects ingredients under supply constraints, and decides when to cook a dish to maximize reward. We compare tabular control (Q-learning) with linear function approximation for the action-value function, and we analyze how state representation affects learning and convergence. In particular, we contrast an intentionally lossy, non-Markov representation (\texttt{simple}) with a Markov representation that augments the state with a visited-cells mask (\texttt{mask}). Across multiple random seeds we report learning curves, final evaluation return, and interpretable domain metrics (waste and incompatible ingredient usage).

\section{Introduction}
Reinforcement learning (RL) studies how an agent can learn to act optimally through interaction with an environment modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) \cite{SuttonBarto2018}. In small discrete domains, tabular methods such as Q-learning can converge to the optimal action-value function under standard assumptions \cite{Watkins1992}. In larger state spaces, value function approximation is typically required to enable generalization \cite{SuttonBarto2018}.

This report focuses on \emph{RL Chef}, a compact gridworld designed to highlight two key themes: (i) the trade-off between tabular control and linear function approximation, and (ii) the critical role of state representation and Markovity. The environment includes delayed decision-making (choosing when to cook), penalties for waste, and constraints induced by one-time ingredient availability, creating a non-trivial exploration--exploitation problem even on a small grid.


\section{Objectives}
The objectives of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Model the cooking task as an MDP and implement it with the Gymnasium API \cite{Gymnasium}.
\item Implement and compare:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item tabular Q-learning (and optionally SARSA);
  \item linear action-value approximation trained with temporal-difference updates.
  \end{itemize}
\item Analyze the impact of state representation by comparing an intentionally lossy, non-Markov representation (\texttt{simple}) with a Markov representation that augments the state with a visited-cells mask (\texttt{mask}).
\item Produce reproducible results across multiple seeds, including learning curves, evaluation metrics, and domain-specific diagnostics.
\end{itemize}


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Dataset}
No external dataset is used. All experience is generated online by interacting with the environment and collecting trajectories of $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$.


\subsection{Optimization and Regularization}
We use $\epsilon$-greedy exploration with an optional linear decay schedule $\epsilon_t$ from $\epsilon_0$ to $\epsilon_{\mathrm{final}}$ over a fixed number of episodes. The discount factor is fixed to $\gamma \in (0,1)$. For tabular control we update a Q-table (Q-learning update); for linear approximation we parameterize:
\[
Q_\theta(s,a) = w_a^\top \phi(s) + b_a
\]
and perform semi-gradient temporal-difference updates on the parameters. L2 regularization is available in the implementation but is set to $0$ in the main experiments.

\subsection{Environment and State Representations}
The environment is a $5\times5$ grid. Each cell contains one ingredient type; ingredients can be collected at most once per episode (supply constraint). The agent chooses among 5 actions: 4-direction movement plus \texttt{cook}. The \texttt{cook} action ends the episode and yields a reward based on the best feasible recipe given the inventory, minus penalties for waste and incompatible ingredient combinations.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{rlchef/env_layout.png}
\caption{Static overview of the fixed grid layout used in experiments (ingredient id and short name per cell).}
\label{fig:env_layout}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Environment parameters and recipe definitions (auto-generated from code).}
\label{tab:env_specs}
\input{results/rlchef/env_specs.tex}
\end{table}

We compare two discrete state keys for tabular control:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\texttt{simple}}: position and inventory counts (lossy / non-Markov because it omits which cells have been depleted).
\item \textbf{\texttt{mask}}: augments \texttt{simple} with a bitmask of visited/depleted cells, restoring Markovity under a fixed grid layout.
\end{itemize}

Both agents also receive a continuous observation vector with normalized features (position, current-cell ingredient one-hot, availability, inventory, remaining supply; and optional budget/round features in the challenging variant).


\section{Experiments}
We run a benchmark that compares four configurations across multiple random seeds:
\begin{itemize}
\item Q-learning with \texttt{simple} state;
\item Q-learning with \texttt{mask} state;
\item linear function approximation with \texttt{simple} observation;
\item linear function approximation with \texttt{mask} observation.
\end{itemize}

Each run trains for 20{,}000 episodes with $\epsilon$-greedy exploration ($\epsilon_0=0.3 \rightarrow \epsilon_{\mathrm{final}}=0.05$ linearly over 3{,}000 episodes) and uses 10 random seeds. Final evaluation sets $\epsilon=0$ and estimates metrics over 1{,}000 evaluation episodes per run. We report the mean and standard deviation (across seeds) of evaluation return, average steps, and domain-specific diagnostics (waste and incompatibility). Additionally, we compute sample-efficiency proxies from the training curve: the average training return over all episodes (AUC proxy) and the mean return over the last episodes (stability / late performance).

\subsection{Implementation details and reproducibility}
All experiments can be reproduced by running \texttt{python -m rlchef.experiments} followed by \texttt{python -m rlchef.analyze}. Raw outputs are saved to \texttt{results/rlchef/}: \texttt{summaries.json} (final metrics per run), \texttt{curves.json} (per-episode learning curves), and the generated plots (\texttt{.png}) and tables (\texttt{.tex}) referenced throughout this report.

Compute cost is modest for this environment: on a standard macOS laptop, a single seed run with 20{,}000 training episodes (covering all four configurations) takes on the order of tens of seconds, and the 10-seed benchmark completes within minutes; plotting/aggregation adds negligible overhead relative to training.\footnote{Wall-clock time depends on hardware and Python environment; the goal here is to provide an order-of-magnitude estimate.}

\subsection{Results}
Table~\ref{tab:metrics} reports aggregate evaluation metrics across seeds. Q-learning achieves high return with low variability: $3.307\pm0.104$ for \texttt{simple} and $3.177\pm0.079$ for \texttt{mask}. In contrast, the linear baseline is considerably less consistent, achieving $1.652\pm0.718$ in evaluation (Table~\ref{tab:metrics}) and showing a wide inter-seed dispersion (Figure~\ref{fig:boxplot}).

Figure~\ref{fig:aggregate} summarizes training dynamics (moving average; mean $\pm$ std across seeds). Tabular learning reaches a stable plateau within a few thousand episodes. The \texttt{mask} representation does not improve over \texttt{simple} within our training budget; a plausible explanation is that augmenting the state with a visited-cells mask increases the effective tabular state space, which can slow down learning despite restoring Markovity in principle. Under a fixed grid layout, the lossy \texttt{simple} key may still be sufficient to learn a near-optimal policy for this task.

Beyond scalar return, domain diagnostics reveal qualitative policy differences. Q-learning yields short episodes ($\approx 4$ steps on average), suggesting it learns to collect a small, high-value set of ingredients and cook quickly (Figure~\ref{fig:steps}). The linear baseline produces significantly longer episodes ($25.02\pm13.26$ steps), higher waste ($2.18\pm1.41$), and a broader trade-off curve (Figure~\ref{fig:tradeoff}), consistent with slower/less decisive policies and suboptimal ingredient collection. Figure~\ref{fig:made} shows that the tabular policy produces a more diverse recipe mix, while the linear baseline concentrates on a smaller set of outcomes and exhibits a larger fraction of failures (no feasible recipe cooked).

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:sample_eff} compares sample-efficiency proxies derived from training curves. Q-learning achieves higher average train return (AUC proxy) and higher late-stage performance, while the linear baseline is lower on both metrics, matching the observed evaluation gap.

\subsection{Discussion and Limitations}
These results highlight a key practical point: in small, structured discrete environments, tabular control can be both data-efficient and stable. The linear baseline here uses a simple feature vector and an off-policy TD update, which can be sensitive to feature design, exploration schedule, and reward shaping. High variance across seeds (Figure~\ref{fig:boxplot}) suggests that learning outcomes depend strongly on early trajectories and exploration decisions.

The \texttt{simple}/\texttt{mask} comparison should be interpreted carefully for function approximation. In our implementation, \texttt{state\_mode} affects only the discrete tabular key; the observation features used by the linear model are unchanged, hence \texttt{simple} and \texttt{mask} are expected to be identical for the linear baseline (as observed in Table~\ref{tab:metrics} and Figures~\ref{fig:steps}--\ref{fig:sample_eff}).

Limitations include the absence of extensive hyperparameter tuning and the simplicity of the linear approximator. Future work could (i) add the visited-cells mask (or a learned memory) to the feature representation for function approximation, (ii) evaluate on randomized grid layouts for robustness, and (iii) compare additional baselines (e.g., SARSA, eligibility traces, or more stable variants of Q-learning with function approximation \cite{TsitsiklisVanRoy1997}).

\section{Conclusion}
We presented \emph{RL Chef}, a compact Gymnasium environment designed to compare tabular control with linear value function approximation and to study the impact of state representation. Across 10 seeds, tabular Q-learning reliably achieves high return with low variability, while the linear baseline is less stable and incurs higher waste and longer episodes. The analysis illustrates how representational choices and approximation can dominate performance even in small environments, motivating careful state design and more expressive function approximation for scalable RL.
